		<h2>THE RACE</h2>
		<p> tortoise, challenged him to a race. All the animals in the forest gathered to watch.
Hare ran down the road for a while and then paused to tell everyone at Nimzy's bakery that he would win the 
competition and would be awarded alot of money,that he will buy one of every item in the store but 
he couldn'take his eyes off the cheese cake. He thought to himself,"tortoise is extra slow i can sit here,eat more than 2 cake slices and still win".Then he ordered 4 slices of cheese cakes,took his time to have a chat 
thinking, "There is plenty of time to relax."
